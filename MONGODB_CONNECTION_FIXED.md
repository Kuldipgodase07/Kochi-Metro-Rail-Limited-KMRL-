## 📝 Root Cause

**MongoDB Atlas Connection Timeout**:

- MongoDB Atlas connections can timeout after period of inactivity
- Connection pool needs to be refreshed
- Server restart re-establishes connection

**Prevention**:

- Keep backend server running
- MongoDB has automatic reconnection logic
- Consider connection pooling settings in production
