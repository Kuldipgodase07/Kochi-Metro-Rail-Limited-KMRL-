# ✅ Train Dropdown Fixed - All 100 Trains Now Visible!

## Problem

When you clicked "Select Train", the dropdown was empty - no trains were showing even though you have 100 trains in your database.

## Root Cause

The **field name mismatch** between frontend and backend:

- **Backend API** returns: `id` (lowercase)
- **Frontend expected**: `_id` (with underscore)

Your database has 100 trains (R1028 to R1100) but they weren't showing because the frontend was looking for the wrong field name.

## Solution Applied

### Fixed 3 places in `MaintenanceModulePage.tsx`:

1. **Interface Definition** (Line ~80):

   ```typescript
   // BEFORE
   interface Trainset {
     _id: string;    // ❌ Wrong field name
     ...
   }

   // AFTER
   interface Trainset {
     id: string;     // ✅ Matches API response
     ...
   }
   ```

2. **Train Selection** (Line ~475):

   ```typescript
   // BEFORE
   trainsetId: selectedTrain?._id || ""; // ❌ Wrong field

   // AFTER
   trainsetId: selectedTrain?.id || ""; // ✅ Correct field
   ```

3. **Dropdown Rendering** (Line ~484):

   ```typescript
   // BEFORE
   <SelectItem key={train._id} value={train.number}>  // ❌ Wrong field

   // AFTER
   <SelectItem key={train.id} value={train.number}>   // ✅ Correct field
   ```
