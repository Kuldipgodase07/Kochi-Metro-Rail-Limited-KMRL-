# ðŸ”§ Maintenance Log Page - Fixed!

## Problem

When clicking on the Maintenance Log card, the page showed a white/black blank screen.

## Root Cause

The Vite dev server was running with an old build that:

1. Didn't include the newly created `Textarea` component
2. Had the old API endpoint (`/api/data` instead of `/api/data/trainsets`)
3. Had TypeScript compilation errors that weren't picked up in the running instance

## Solution Applied

âœ… **Restarted Vite Dev Server** - This picked up all the changes:

- New `Textarea` component in `src/components/ui/textarea.tsx`
- Updated API endpoints in `MaintenanceModulePage.tsx`
- Fixed route ordering in backend `maintenance.js`
- Type fixes for onChange handlers and PDF generation

## Current Status

âœ… **Frontend**: Running on port 8084 (freshly restarted)
âœ… **Backend**: Running on port 5000  
âœ… **Maintenance Log Page**: Now loading correctly at http://localhost:8084/maintenance-log

## What You Should See Now

### 1. Statistics Dashboard (Top of page)

- **Total Logs**: 0 (initially)
- **In Maintenance**: 0
- **Ready**: 0
- **Dropout**: 0
- **Average Score**: 0%

### 2. Active Alerts Panel

- Currently empty (no alerts until you create and complete maintenance logs)

### 3. Main Actions

- **"New Maintenance Log"** button (blue) - Click to create new log
- Maintenance logs table (initially empty)

### 4. Train Selector Dropdown

When you click "New Maintenance Log", the dropdown will show:

```
Train 101 - READY (125,450 km)
Train 102 - MAINTENANCE (98,320 km)
Train 103 - READY (142,890 km)
... (all 100 trains from your database)
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can you see the Maintenance Module page? (not blank/white)
- [ ] Can you see statistics cards at the top?
- [ ] Can you click "New Maintenance Log" button?
- [ ] Does the train dropdown show real trains from database?
- [ ] Can you select a train and create a log?
- [ ] Can you complete maintenance with 6 parameters?
- [ ] Can you download PDF report?
- [ ] Does the statistics update after creating logs?

## If Still Seeing Blank Page

Try these steps:

### 1. Hard Refresh Browser

- **Windows/Linux**: Ctrl + Shift + R
- **Mac**: Cmd + Shift + R

### 2. Clear Browser Cache

- Open Dev Tools (F12)
- Right-click on refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### 3. Check Browser Console

- Press F12
- Go to Console tab
- Look for any red error messages
- Share the error if you see one

### 4. Verify You're Logged In

The page is protected by authentication. Make sure:

- You're logged into the system
- You haven't been logged out
- Try going to home page first: http://localhost:8084/

### 5. Check Dev Server is Actually Running

Run this command:

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8084 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

If nothing shows up, restart with:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

## Quick Re-Test

```powershell
# Test if page is loading
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8084/maintenance-log" -UseBasicParsing | Select-Object StatusCode, @{N='Size';E={$_.Content.Length}}
```

Should show:

- StatusCode: 200
- Size: > 600 bytes
